The program will depict two options and determine which of the two options offer a greater pay rate. Option 1 offers $100 per day while option 2 offers incremental amounts (x2) over a certain time period (10 days)

Option 1 will output 1000 because $100 * 10 days
option 2 is a double multiplier over a 10 day period. 
(1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 + 512)
A for loop can iterate from 1 to 10 and the total sum can be saved in a variable called temp

If options 1 and 2 are similar then the output will be "Both options are similar"
Otherwise options 1 or 2 will output depending on which option offers a greater pay rate
